Hi! <br>
<br>
I am Ahmed. I study Business Economics at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. I wrote my thesis about the effectiveness of carbon taxation in reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector. <br>
<br>
Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the Department of Agricultural Markets, at the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies (IAMO) in Halle. <br>
<br>
My interest focuses on econometrics and statistics, development and environmental economics, finance, market research, data science, and machine learning. <br>
<br>
Beyond my work, I am interested in movies and series, philosophy, classical music, chess, and running. <br>
<br>
