Hi!
I am Ahmed. I study Business Economics at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. I wrote my thesis about the effectiveness of carbon taxation in reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector. 
Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the Department of Agricultural Markets, at the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies (IAMO) in Halle. 
My interest focuses on econometrics and statistics, development and environmental economics, finance, market research, data science, and machine learning.
