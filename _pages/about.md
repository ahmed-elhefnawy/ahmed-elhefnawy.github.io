Hi! <br>
<br>
My name is Ahmed. I study Business Economics at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. I wrote my thesis about the effectiveness of carbon taxation in reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector. <br>
<br>
I am a Research Assistant at the Department of Agricultural Markets at the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies (IAMO) in Halle. <br>
<br>
My interests focus on Econometrics and Statistics, Development and Environmental Economics, Finance, Market Research, Data Science, and Machine Learning. <br>
<br>
Beyond my work, I am interested in movies and series, philosophy, classical music, chess, and running. <br>
