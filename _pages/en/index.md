I am Ahmed. I am a Master's student in Sustainable Management & Technology at the <a href="https://www.cs.tum.de/en/study/master/sustainable-management-technology" target="_blank">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a>, majoring in **Biotechnology & Materials Science**.

I work at the <a href="https://www.ifo.de/en/ifo-homepage" target="_blank">ifo Institute</a> on a project on how different investment behavior influences the energy transition in Europe, particularly the electricity market. At <a href="https://www.stat.lmu.de/soda/en/" target="_blank">SODA Lab</a>, LMU Munich, I am involved in a project with the Deutsche Bundesbank to extract firm-level data from companies' sustainability reports using ML, NLP, and LLMs.

My interests include **(corporate) sustainability & ESG management, energy & climate analytics (Green Tech), (Data-Driven) consulting & economic analysis, data science & ML**, and I love to extract meaningful insights from unstructured information. 

Honoured to be nominated for <a href="https://www.ja.tum.de/ja/projekte/class-2025/kunst/" target="_blank">TUM: Junge Akademie (TUMJA)</a>, the scholarship program of TUM for talented and dedicated students, our team of five students is working on understanding the barriers to large-scale adoption of **seaweed-based packaging** in the food sector, particularly in comparison to traditional plastic packaging.

In practice, I am comfortable working with **Python, R, Stata, Git**, and **LaTeX**. 

I enjoy watching movies, going to the cinema, reading, consuming philosophical content, and running occasionally!
