The Maddison Project is one of the most famous projects in Economics. It
started with the work of [Angus
Maddison](http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/oriindex.htm) (1926-2010) and
after his death in 2010, a group of his colleagues initiated his work
again.

We use the Maddison project’s data of the real GDP per capita in the
long run to have a broader look at the countries’ development in that
regard.

We did plot the data as a `shinyapp`. You can take a look at it
[here](https://ahmed-elhefnawy.shinyapps.io/per_capita_over_time/)
